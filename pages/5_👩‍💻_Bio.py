# add comments about motivation here:
# col2.markdown('<p style="text-align: justify;">My journey towards developing a CNN-based tumor classifier for MRI scans is deeply rooted in my personal battle with hydrocephalus, a brain disorder that has profoundly impacted my life. This experience has not only given me a unique insight into the challenges faced by individuals with neurological conditions but also ignited a burning passion to leverage the power of technology for medical advancements. Recognizing the critical role of early and accurate tumor detection in improving patient outcomes, I was inspired to embark on this project. </p>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
# col2.markdown("<p style='text-align: justify;'>My aim is to harness the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks to analyze MRI scans with greater precision and efficiency. By doing so, I aspire to contribute to a world where the diagnosis of brain tumors is not only swift but also more accurate, reducing the uncertainty and anxiety experienced by patients. This project is not just a pursuit of technological innovation; it's a personal crusade to transform the landscape of neurological healthcare, driven by my own experiences and challenges with hydrocephalus.</p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
